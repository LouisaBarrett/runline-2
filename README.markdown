## Developing

For OAuth2 to work properly you need to do two things:

### Credentials in the Environment

Define two environment variables by running these instructions in the *same* terminal where you're going to start the server:

```plain
export MMF_API_KEY="qjy542tq9waw28njuqv7hz4ttddc2bch"
export MMF_API_SECRET="bKe5xBJdqtppdTqS3PYvyNn4xUj75nJXFFqT2ThuN5t"
```

### Using a Special URL

Access the app through this URL: http://www.127.0.0.1.xip.io:3000/
