## Developing

For OAuth2 to work properly you need to do two things:

### Credentials in the Environment

Ensure you have the app environment variables (MMF_API_KEY and MMF_API_SECRET) saved in the .env file in the root of your directory.

### Using a Special URL

Access the app through this URL: http://www.127.0.0.1.xip.io:3000/
